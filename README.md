# determination-of-mutation-frequencies-COSMIC-cancer-database

These are two simple python 2.7 scripts to extract, evaluate and visualise the annotation frequency of mutations from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (Cosmic) database. The filters are set to discard SNP's, remove multiple annotated samples and only include mutation with known AA position. The script determines for each gene and for each transcript the mutation count, the relative frequency and a rank. The output of the Position_frequency_mutation.py script is a textfile including the information 'Mutation', 'Gene', 'Transcript', 'Mutation Count', 'Gene Count', 'Relative frequency', 'Rank', 'Rank score', 'Total ranks', 'Relative position' per Amino Acid position. The Classifying_plotting_mut_freq.py script classifies each AA position specific mutation non-parametrically with an outlier score to discriminate between 'Highly, Mediumly and Poorly' annotated mutation. This score can appended to the output file of the Position_frequency_mutation.py script. As another option, the data can be plotted as a histogram.
